	<h2>a.k.a everything you've wanted to know, but were too afraid to ask</h2>

	<p>Hi there. So you're dying to know more, huh? Well this was a good place to come, and we're here to tell you every last detail.</p>

	<!--<p>Skip to:</p>
	<ul style="list-style:none;">
		<li>About <a href="#site">This Site</a></li>
		<li>About <a href="#us">Us</a>, <a href="#matt">Matt</a>, <a href="#jaimie">Jaimie</a>, and <a href="#archie">Archie</a>.</li>
	</ul>-->
	
	<p>I ( Matt ) struggled with idea of how to propose for a long time, and those of you who know me know that I'm not exactly an outgoing person of grand romantic gestures &#8212; no Chuck Bass that's for sure ( shameless gossip girl reference ). Nor am I a fan of the traditional. So naturally, this ruled out many of the usual acts which "proposal" brings to mind. I guess I'm just weird.</p>

	<p>Anyway, so I thought to myself while trying to sleep one night: "How can I harness my nerdy powers for romance?", and the idea for this site came to mind. The hardest part is/was/has been trying to find time to work on it while keeping it a secret ( I'm typing this while she's on the the other side of the room right now actually ).</p>

    <p>So I hope you enjoy it!</p>

		<p>Writing about yourself is difficult because it's impossible to be unbiased, but I'll give it a shot: I am the greatest thing since sliced bread. A few of my inventions: the internet, sliced bread, calculus...</p>
		<p>Ok I'm kidding &#8212; but really though &#8212; the real story is not quite as spectacular:<p>
		<p>I currently attend Florida State doing math stuff. I spend most of my free time makin' music, mathing, eating / cooking tasty foods, and chillin' with my homeboy, Archie.</p>

	<h1 id="jaimie">Jaimie</h1>

		<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="height:200px; width:570px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="/img/about/j.jpg"></div>
		
		<p>Jaimie currently works as a Systems Analyst for a Health care organization by day and professional cat-enjoyer by night ( and day ).</p>
		
		<p>In her off-time, you can find her face-deep in a novel, baking goodies or getting crafty with any loose twine, beads or fabric she can get her hands on. <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/littlejaimie" target="_blank">In fact, you can visit her etsy store here.</a></p>

	<h1 id="archie">Archie</h1>

	<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="height:200px; width:570px; margin-bottom: 10px;" src="/img/about/archie.jpg" title="*Areow*"></div>

	<p>Archie is a 3.5 year old, single ( ladies ) kitten at heart who enjoys the finer things in life such as: napping, yelling, and biting toes.</p>
  <p>You can find him spending his leisure time ( i.e. all his time ) basking in slivers of sunlight, box-hopping, hiding in closets ( due to noises exceeding maximum kitten decibel level ), or knocking things off anything with a level surface besides the floor.<p>
